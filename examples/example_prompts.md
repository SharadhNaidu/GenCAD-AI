Make a hollow cylinder with outer diameter 40mm, inner diameter 20mm, and height 30mm
```

## Mechanical Parts

### Simple Bracket
```
Design a simple L-shaped bracket that is 60mm x 40mm x 5mm thick with two 6mm mounting holes
```

### Washer

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: Include dimensions, materials, and details
2. **Use Standard Units**: Specify mm, cm, or inches
3. **Simple First**: Start with basic shapes before complex designs
4. **Describe Purpose**: Mention what the object is for
5. **Include Tolerances**: Specify clearances for moving parts

## Common Dimensions Reference

- **Screw Holes**: M3=3mm, M4=4mm, M5=5mm, M6=6mm, M8=8mm
- **Common Thicknesses**: Sheet metal: 1-3mm, Brackets: 3-5mm
- **Standard Diameters**: Pipes: 15mm, 20mm, 25mm, 32mm
- **Typical Heights**: Small parts: 10-50mm, Brackets: 50-100mm

## Troubleshooting Prompts

If a prompt doesn't work well, try:
- Adding more specific dimensions
- Breaking complex shapes into simpler parts
- Using more common geometric terms
- Specifying the manufacturing method (3D printed, machined, etc.)
